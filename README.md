ðŸ§¬ Genetic Variant Classification Using Machine Learning
This project analyzes and classifies genetic variants using data from ClinVar â€” a public database containing information about human genetic variations and their relationships to diseases. The objective is to build a predictive model to classify these variants into categories such as benign, pathogenic, or uncertain significance.

ðŸ“š Context
Genetic variants are often classified by clinical laboratories into categories such as:

Benign

Likely benign

Uncertain significance

Likely pathogenic

Pathogenic

Conflicting interpretations can make clinical decision-making challenging. This project aims to create a machine learning model to assist in predicting variant classification based on publicly available ClinVar data.

ðŸš€ Features
Preprocessing of genetic data

Visualization of missing data patterns

Feature encoding with category_encoders

Classification using CatBoostClassifier

Evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Install required Python libraries:

pip install catboost category_encoders

Additional dependencies:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

missingno

ðŸ“ˆ Models Used
CatBoostClassifier, XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), and LightGBM: Chosen for its efficiency with categorical features and high performance on tabular data.

ðŸ“Š Results
Model accuracy and confusion matrix are generated to evaluate prediction performance. You can run the notebook end-to-end to reproduce the results.
